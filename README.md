# Spam-Message-Filter
A machine learning spam classification with naive bayes filtering.
Project contributor: Bhaskar Thakur
Algorithm used: Naive Bayes
The data-set was taken from kaggle.com and the copy of the data set is present in the repo. I have used Python's inbuilt numpy and panda's library to use the inbuilt functions. I have also used Python's matplotlib and sklearn to do a data-analysis. Python's panda dataframe has been used to clean data.The code has been throughly explained by comment lines at every step.
